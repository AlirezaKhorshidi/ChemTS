# ChemTS
Molecule Design using Monte Carlo Tree Search with Neural Rollout. ChemTS can design novel materials with desired HOMO-LUMO gap and interal energy. Combining with rDock, ChemTS can design molecules active to target proteins.


#  Train a RNN model for molecule generation
Run python train_RNN.py to train the RNN model. GPU is highly recommended for reducing the training time.
